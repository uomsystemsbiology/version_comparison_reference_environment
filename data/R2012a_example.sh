echo "### Overview
This shell script executes MATLAB code which is part of a model for activation (phosphorylation) of ERK-MAPK signalling pathway components across the depth of human epidermis.  This version of the code was compiled with MATLAB x7.14.0.739 (R2012a) and the MATLAB Compiler v4.17.  

This reference environment demonstrates that a single piece of code can produce two different results when run with different versions of a programming language, or different supporting libraries.   Running this script and the script 'R2015a_example.sh' side-by-side produces different values for the baseline and amplitude values of Ca^2+ (tissue calcium) and CaM (plasma-mebrane calmodulin), even though the underlying MATLAB code is the same.     

The complete version of the code is part of the manuscript 'Regulation of ERK-MAPK Signalling in Human Epidermis', found here:
